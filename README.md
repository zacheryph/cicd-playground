# CI/CD Playground

this is a playground for me to test ci/cd related items.
If I bother too I will make mention of them here.

# renovate

anything related to testing out renovate configurations and
related resources will go into the renovate/ directory with
`/.github/renovate.json5` being the configuration.

# workflow trigger gitops

* `/.github/workflows/build.yaml`
* `/.github/workflows/trigger.yaml`

this is testing _gitops in actions_ using actions to trigger
workflows in _other_ repositories, alter and commit/create
a pull request for changes.
